# About me ðŸ‘‹

<p>I was born in 1957 to a Gujrati community of Shiâ€™ah Ismaili Aga Khani but later converted to Sunni Muslim.  My father Abdullah and my elder brother Barkat Ali never followed Aga Khani Ismaili practices of religion.  &#160; In year 2000, I joined mainstream Sunni Muslim Brotherhood (Ahle Sunnat wal Jamâ€™at) branch of Islam.  Soon my children, and later my wife followed me; the family became part of larger <b>Muslim Ummâ€™ah</b>.</p

I resigned from UBL in 1994. I joined KIET, a degree awarding institute approved by HEC, in year 2000.  I served KIET as DBA/Manager MIS for eleven years.  With a small team of three programmers and myself, I developed web-based Student Database System (in Oracle) for KIET, capable of managing multiple campuses data of students, teachers and staff.

<p>At age 57, I learned Arabic language from free Internet resources of Tanzeem-e-Islami (course videos of teacher Aamir Suhail), to understand Qurâ€™an in Arabic language â€” the language chosen by Allah SWT for HIS final message to the mankind through HIS final messenger Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings be upon him).</p>
