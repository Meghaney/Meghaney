# About me ðŸ‘‹

<p>I was born in 1957 to a Gujrati community of Shiâ€™ah Ismaili Aga Khani but later converted to Sunni Muslim.  My father Abdullah and my elder brother Barkat Ali never followed Aga Khani Ismaili practices of religion.  In year 2000, I joined mainstream Sunni Muslim Brotherhood (Ahle Sunnat wal Jamâ€™at) branch of Islam.  Soon my children, and later my wife followed me; my family became part of larger Muslim Ummâ€™ah.</p>
